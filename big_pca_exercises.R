  #   max.corr: maximum correlation between variables

# First, use sparse matrices and check the size

# Task 1: Generate an n x p matrix X, where each row is an
#         observation with covariance matrix m.sparse.  Check that the covariance
#         is correct.  Generate a plot of the first row showing that adjacent columns
#         are correlated with one another.

U <- chol(m.sparse)


# Task 2: Use scale() to center and scale the columns.
# Task 3: Calculate the principal components using the four
#         functions svd(), irlba(), eigen(), and irlba().
#         With irlba(), just look at the top five.
#         Confirm that they give the same answer.  Note:
#         you need to think about the normalizing constants.
# Task 4: Use microbenchmark to compare the speeds.  What method
#         is the fastest?
# Task 5: Implement the power method to find the top eigenvalue
#         and eigenvector.  (You can use a for loop.)  Check that
#         it matches the other methods.
# Task 6: Use your favorite method to experiment with PCA on
#         non-centered, non-scaled columns.  How does centering and
#         scaling affect the PCA analysis?

# If you get stuck, you can find answers to all but task 6 in big_pca.R, though it will
# be best if you do it yourself!
